## Weyoco PM Internship – Screening Assignment

This repository contains a simulated product backlog for Weyoco,
created as part of the PM Internship screening assignment.

Contents:
- GitHub Issues: Clear, actionable development tickets
- GitHub Project Board: Backlog organization and prioritization system


Notes:
- Each issue should have 1 Product label, 1 Issue Type label, and 1 Priority label to ensure clarity and efficient prioritization.
- QA labels are prepared upfront but applied only after development is completed.

The goal is to demonstrate product operations, documentation clarity,
and prioritization thinking for a small, fast-moving team.
